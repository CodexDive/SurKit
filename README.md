## ðŸŒŸ Core features

- **Multi-Model Integration**: Integrates a variety of data-driven or physics-constrained neural network surrogate models for solving PDEs (e.g., PINN, FNO, UNet, AFNO, etc.).
- **Active Learning**: Includes multiple sampling strategies such as Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, and adaptive sampling.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides uncertainty quantification through neural network ensembles and Bayesian neural networks.
- **Standardized Interface**: Features a unified **API** design that supports rapid training and allows for customization through the assembly or replacement of **cores**-level modules.
- **Multi-GPU Training**: Supports distributed data parallelism for efficient training.
- **Multiple Backends**: Offers a variety of backends, each with its own unique features and advantages.
